  abstract       = {This study sought an effective detection method not only for flame but also for the smoke generated in the event of a fire. To this end, the flame region was pre-processed using the color conversion and corner detection method, and the smoke region could be detected using the dark channel prior and optical flow. This eliminates unnecessary background regions and allows selection of fire-related regions. Where there was a pre-processed region of interest, inference was conducted using a deep-learning-based convolutional neural network (CNN) to accurately determine whether it was a flame or smoke. Through this approach, the detection accuracy is improved by 5.5% for flame and 6% for smoke compared to when a fire is detected through the object detection model without separate pre-processing.},

  abstract       = {Accurate fire identification can help to control fires. Traditional fire detection methods are mainly based on temperature or smoke detectors. These detectors are susceptible to damage or interference from the outside environment. Meanwhile, most of the current deep learning methods are less discriminative with respect to dynamic fire and have lower detection precision when a fire changes. Therefore, we propose a dynamic convolution YOLOv5 fire detection method using a video sequence. Our method first uses the K-mean++ algorithm to optimize anchor box clustering; this significantly reduces the rate of classification error. Then, the dynamic convolution is introduced into the convolution layer of YOLOv5. Finally, pruning of the network heads of YOLOv5&rsquo;s neck and head is carried out to improve the detection speed. Experimental results verify that the proposed dynamic convolution YOLOv5 fire detection method demonstrates better performance than the YOLOv5 method in recall, precision and F1-score. In particular, compared with three other deep learning methods, the precision of the proposed algorithm is improved by 13.7%, 10.8% and 6.1%, respectively, while the F1-score is improved by 15.8%, 12% and 3.8%, respectively. The method described in this paper is applicable not only to short-range indoor fire identification but also to long-range outdoor fire detection.},

  abstract = {As one of the important research topics in machine learning, loss function plays an important role in the construction of machine learning algorithms and the improvement of their performance, which has been concerned and explored by many researchers. But it still has a big gap to summarize, analyze and compare the classical loss functions. Therefore, this paper summarizes and analyzes 31 classical loss functions in machine learning. Specifically, we describe the loss functions from the aspects of traditional machine learning and deep learning respectively. The former is divided into classification problem, regression problem and unsupervised learning according to the task type. The latter is subdivided according to the application scenario, and here we mainly select object detection and face recognition to introduces their loss functions. In each task or application, in addition to analyzing each loss function from formula, meaning, image and algorithm, the loss functions under the same task or application are also summarized and compared to deepen the understanding and provide help for the selection and improvement of loss function.},
